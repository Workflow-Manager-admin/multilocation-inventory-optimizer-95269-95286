- Data visualizations likely have hover states for additional information

## General Design Principles
- Clean, minimal design with ample white space
- Clear visual hierarchy with consistent spacing
- Professional color scheme with strategic use of accent colors
- Emphasis on data presentation and readability
- Consistent component styling throughout the interface
